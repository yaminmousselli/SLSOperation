# CS 4400 - Introduction to Database Systems

## SLSOperation   

We implemented AGILE workflow methodologies to design and develop an online database system through a web application. During phase 1, we analyzed and designed the database through both enhanced entity relationship (EER) and information flow diagrams, and devised logical constraints for the system. During phase 2, we improved the EER Diagram, created a relational schema diagram, and created table statements. During phase 3, we used a combination of PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and MYSQLv5.1+ to build the database system. <br/>
